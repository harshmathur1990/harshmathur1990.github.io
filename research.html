    <p>
        Harsh Mathur’s research focuses on understanding the role of magnetic fields in the Sun’s chromosphere and their impact on solar and stellar phenomena. By studying the diagnostic capabilities of the Hα spectral line, he has shown that it effectively probes the magnetic field in higher layers of the chromosphere, complementing the insights provided by the Ca II IR triplet. His work sheds light on processes such as coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, contributing to a better understanding of the Sun's dynamic behavior. These studies also provide a basis for exploring how stellar magnetic activity influences planetary atmospheres and habitability in other star systems.
